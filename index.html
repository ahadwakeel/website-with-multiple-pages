    <p>A banknote – also called a bill (North American English), paper money, or simply a note – is a type of negotiable
        promissory note, made by a bank or other licensed authority, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were
        originally issued by commercial banks, which were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually
        gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes
        only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank.[1] Commercial banknotes have primarily been
        replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks or monetary authorities.</p>

    <p>National banknotes are often – but not always – legal tender, meaning that courts of law are required to
        recognize them as satisfactory payment of money debts.[2] Historically, banks sought to ensure that they could
        always pay customers in coins when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of "backing" notes with
        something of substance is the basis for the history of central banks backing their currencies in gold or silver.
        Today, most national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by fiat.
        With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, coins are used for lower valued
        monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.</p>

    <p>Code of Hammurabi Law 100 (c. 1755–1750 BC) stipulated repayment of a loan by a debtor to a creditor on a
        schedule with a maturity date specified in written contractual terms.[3][4][5] Law 122 stipulated that a
        depositor of gold, silver, or other chattel/movable property for safekeeping must present all articles and a
        signed contract of bailment to a notary before depositing the articles with a banker, and Law 123 stipulated
        that a banker was discharged of any liability from a contract of bailment if the notary denied the existence of
        the contract. Law 124 stipulated that a depositor with a notarized contract of bailment was entitled to redeem
        the entire value of their deposit, and Law 125 stipulated that a banker was liable for replacement of deposits
        stolen while in their possession.[6][7][5]</p>

    <p>In China during the Han dynasty, promissory notes appeared in 118 BC and were made of leather.[8] Rome may have
        used a durable lightweight substance as promissory notes in 57 AD which have been found in London.[9] However,
        Carthage was purported to have issued bank notes on parchment or leather before 146 BC. Hence Carthage may be
        the oldest user of lightweight promissory notes.[10][11][12] The first known banknote was first developed in
        China during the Tang and Song dynasties, starting in the 7th century. Its roots were in merchant receipts of
        deposit during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of
        copper coinage in large commercial transactions.[13][14][15] During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), banknotes were
        adopted by the Mongol Empire. In Europe, the concept of banknotes was first introduced during the 13th century
        by travelers such as Marco Polo,[16][17] with European banknotes appearing in 1661 in Sweden.</p>

    <p>Counterfeiting, including the forgery of banknotes, is an inherent challenge in issuing currency. It is countered
        by anticounterfeiting measures in the printing of banknotes. Fighting the counterfeiting of banknotes and
        cheques has been a principal driver of security printing methods development in recent centuries.</p>

    <h2 id="History">History</h2>

    <p>Paper currency first developed in Tang dynasty China during the 7th century, where it was called "flying
        money",[18] although true paper money did not appear until the 11th century, during the Song dynasty. The use of
        paper currency later spread throughout the Mongol Empire or Yuan dynasty China. European explorers like Marco
        Polo introduced the concept in Europe during the 13th century.[16][17] Napoleon issued paper banknotes in the
        early 1800s.[19] Cash paper money originated as receipts for value held on account "value received", and should
        not be conflated with promissory "sight bills" which were issued with a promise to convert at a later date.</p>

    <p>The perception of banknotes as money has evolved over time. Originally, money was based on precious metals.
        Banknotes were seen by some as an I.O.U. or promissory note: a promise to pay someone in precious metal on
        presentation (see representative money). But they were readily accepted – for convenience and security – in
        London, for example, from the late 1600s onwards. With the removal of precious metals from the monetary system,
        banknotes evolved into pure fiat money</p>

    <h2 id="EarlyMoney">Early Chinse Paper Money</h2>

    <p>The first banknote-type instrument was used in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618–907).
        Merchants would issue what are today called promissory notes in the form of receipts of deposit to wholesalers
        to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.[13][14][15] Before these
        notes, circular coins with a rectangular hole in the middle were used. Multiple coins could be strung together
        on a rope. Merchants found that the strings were too heavy to carry around easily, especially for large
        transactions. To solve this problem, coins could be left with a trusted person, with the merchant being given a
        slip of paper (the receipt) recording how much money they had deposited with that person. When they returned
        with the paper to that person, their coins would be returned.</p>

    <p>True paper money, called "jiaozi", developed from these promissory notes by the 11th century, during the Song
        dynasty.[20][21] By 960, the Song government was short of copper for striking coins, and issued the first
        generally circulating notes. These notes were a promise by the ruler to redeem them later for some other object
        of value, usually specie. The issue of credit notes was often for a limited duration, and at some discount to
        the promised amount later. The jiaozi did not replace coins but was used alongside them.</p>

    <p>The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly for the
        issue of these certificates of deposit to several deposit shops.[13] By the early 12th century, the amount of
        banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins.[15] By the
        1120s the central government started to produce its own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing).[13]

        Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that
        each year before 1101, the prefecture of Xin'an (modern Shexian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of
        paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng.[22] In 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided
        to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and
        creating heavy burdens on the people of the region.[23] However, the government still needed masses of paper
        product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper
        money alone, the Song government established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou,[which?]
        Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi.[23]</p>

    <p id="bottom">The workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large; it was recorded in 1175 that the factory
        at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.[23] However, the government issues of paper money
        were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional areas
        of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of three years.[15]

        The geographic limitation changed between 1265 and 1274, when the late southern Song government issued a
        nationwide paper currency standard, which was backed by gold or silver.[15] The range of varying values for
        these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most.[15] Ever after 1107, the
        government printed money in no less than six ink colors and printed notes with intricate designs and sometimes
        even with mixture of a unique fiber in the paper to combat counterfeiting.</p>
